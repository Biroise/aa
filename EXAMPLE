me@computer:~$ python
>>> from pylab import *
>>> import aa
>>> f = aa.open('file.nc')

If you made the changes suggested in INSTALL to your .bashrc, you can simply do this instead
me@computer:~$ aa file.nc
By convention, a 'aa.File' object will be assigne to variable 'f'

If the file contains a single variable, either method will assign the single variable to 'f' in the form of a 'aa.Variable' object

If the file contains several variables, you can access via a dictionary attribute :
>>> f.variables
{'var1': <...>, 'var2': <...> ; ...}
>>> myVariable = f.variables['var2']
OR
>>> myVariable = f.var2
